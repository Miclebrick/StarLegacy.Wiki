# Pipes
Pipes are useful tools that allow you to efficiently and neatly transport and organize items. You can use pipes for managing factories and furnace systems and for unloading/loading material onto ships.

## Containers
Containers store items. Examples of containers are Chests, Trapped chests, Droppers, Dispensers, Hoppers. Hoppers DO NOT work as extractors so they cannot be use to take items out of other storage containers and place them into pipes. Ender chests are also incapable of being used with pipes or extractors.

## Extractor
The only extractor on Star Legacy is the crafting table, which looks like this:

![Extractor]

The extractor takes items out of storage containers and into pipes.

## Exporting
To export items using pipes, you need a crafting table and an exporting inventory, and a glass pipe system. Place the crafting table next to the exporting inventory and connect the glass to the crafting table. The pipe system will then search for another container it is touching and send the items from the exporting inventory to the new container.

## Pipes
Glass pipes are used to make long and potentially complicated systems. Glass pipes attempt to put items into inventory blocks next to them if available and also move onto connected pipes. If there are two possible directions for them to go, they pick randomly, which generally ends up in evenly spreading out the items.

Pipes can be in the form of a glass pain line or full glass block line. Different colored glass pains and full blocks when used in as pipes when touching they will not mix. For example if you have a green line on one side and a red line on the other side and they are touching with no blocks in-between the items going through red will not interfere and will not go into the line of green.

## Set up
To set up a pipe system you need a crafting table, glass (regular/stained) or glass pains (regular/stained), and two separate containers. This is an example of a correctly made pipe system:

![PipeExample1]

In the set up above, an output chest is connected to two input chests, making it so when an item goes in the output chest, it travels into one of the input chests. This is an example of the same system except using glass pains instead of full glass blocks:

Sorting System
Using all this information we can create an automatic, fast, no red-stone, sorting system.

To make a sorting system you will need the following items: -Hopper -Glass Pain (3 different colors) -Chest & Trapped chest -Crafting Table -Item to be sorted -Item for FILLER

To begin construction plan out the area you will want first before following these steps. You will want to plan after looking through the pictures and steps of how to make your sorting system below.

Place down a chest and a crafting table next to it.
Connect and make a pipeline to the crafting table.
Make a second pipeline one block away from the first, so they aren't touching.
Make a row of hoppers between the two pipelines, facing the second.
Place down a row of alternating chests and trapped chests on the other side of the second pipeline.
This should look something like this:

![SortingPipeline]

NOTE: They can be any colors you wish, as long as they are different from each other.
The hoppers are used for the actual sorting. You need to place the items you want in the corresponding chest in the hopper, and then use a filler item(an item to fill empty slots) in the rest of the slots to prevent random items appearing in the chest. Remember that a single hopper can only hold 5 items. Example:

![Hopper]

The Snowballs are the filler item, and the brick, wheat, and sugar cane count as the sorting items.

NOTE: The filler in the system has to be an item that would not flow through your system. If the item is to flow through the system it can go into any chest. To make sure it doesn't, name the item using an anvil.

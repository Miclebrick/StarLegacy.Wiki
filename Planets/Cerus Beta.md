## Quick Notes

Cerus Beta has no atmosphere; thus no air. You need a space suit or environmental helmet outside. PlanetaEremitae is territorial of the south-western corner and dislikes people ruining the landscape without purpose. Slime covers a lot of the land there and isn't friendly. There are huge caves under the map in certain places as well as craters containing iron. Many view it as a worthless planet and only good for trading & slime.

## Quick Notes

This is the Ekateran planet. They make it clear that mining and/or colonizing without their permission is illegal by Ekateran law and is punishable by death. The planet has zombies but not as many as Harenum. Terram has titanium, a resource not found on any other planet. It's in your best interest to join Ekatera, get a pass to be there, or find somewhere else to live.

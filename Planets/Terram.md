## Quick Notes

In this paragraph(s), explain gear generally needed for survival here. Note big threats and possible inconvieniences that will come with being on the planet. End with an explaination of the planet's main use.
On Terram, zombies spawn at night and in dark areas excessively. When using an outdoor base, mob defenders are recommended. It is also ideal to always carry a blaster pistol here. Terram is a great place for farming, as crops grow very fast.

## Quick Notes

This volcanic world requires a spacesuit/environmental module to survive the extreme heat. With a lava river flowing West-East and dotted with islands, this world hosts magma cubes and stridders commonly found along the lava river, however magma cubes have been spotted inland on a rare occasion. It riddled with soul soil and blackstone, making it the only world to obtain either of them.

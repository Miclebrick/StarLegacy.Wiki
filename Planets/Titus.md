## Quick Notes

There are many types of mobs here, consisting of zombies, skeletons, creepers, and spiders. In order to live here you **NEED** a space suit or environmental moded helmet; even if inside. When mining, be careful as lava is a thing here and mobs will swarm you in large quantities. As a final note, Titus is half the size of 13 out of 15 planets, being only 2,500 by 2,500 blocks rather than 5,000 by 5,000 blocks, giving it a low gravitational pull. Even though it has a small size, many places make big ships hard to manuver around, so be cautious.

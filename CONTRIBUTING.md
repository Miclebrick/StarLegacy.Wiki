# Contributing
We appreciate help with the wiki! Follow this guide to start making meaningful contributions to the Star Legacy wiki!

## Getting Started
- First head over to the [project page](https://github.com/StarLegacy/StarLegacy.Wiki).

- Next, select this button on the upper right to get your own mirror/fork of the repository.
![fork]

- After getting your fork, you need to clone it to your local machine to edit.
    - For this step it is easiest to use [Github Dekstop](https://desktop.github.com/)
![clone]

> ***For more in depth information check out [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)***

- Once cloned locally, you're ready to make changes using any one of the many editors for Markdown.
    - We recommend [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
Use one of the Markdown extensions.     
    - More info on proper Markdown formatting below.

> ***Be sure to keep your repository current with the master. Info [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) or if using GitHub Desktop [here](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/syncing-your-branch/).***
    
## Formatting
The wiki uses [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/).

Markdown is very easy to use as it just uses simple symbols to format text. **For example:**

## Making Contributions
- Try to keep your changes minimal.
    - Don't make a bunch of changes to a bunch of pages all at once.
- Make targetted, related changes.
- Keep formatting clean, clear, and concise.
    - Keep individual lines short and sweet.
- If you're adding new things, don't add anything else in that contribution.
- Add relevant images where helpful.
- You can use branches on your repository to split changes up.

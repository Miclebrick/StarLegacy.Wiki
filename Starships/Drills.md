# Starship Drills

Starship drills are drills mounted on starships
and used to mine large areas efficiently.
They require a constant stream of power to work.

Right clicking the sign enables the drill. 
Then, after redetecting, pilot your ship, fly forward,
and it will begin to break blocks in the way.

## Drill Sizes:

**Tier 1**: 5x5 hole

**Tier 2**: 7x7 hole

**Tier 3**: 9x9 hole

The drill doesn't move by itself - you need to mount it on a starship and move the it.

## Multiblock

Materials required: 1x furnace, 1x dropper, 1x noteblock, 1x redstone block, 1x redstone lamp, 2x tier block, 4x glass pane, 1x glass, 1x sign

**Tier 1**: Iron Block

**Tier 2**: Diamond Block

**Tier 3**: Emerald Block

> It is important to note that, unlike power with machines,
tier 2 is diamond and tier 3 is emerald. Don't mix it up!

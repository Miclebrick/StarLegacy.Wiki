# Mining using a Drill
Note: Consult page Drills to see how to make one
Ever wondered how nations like the First Order and Arimfea has so many resources? (besides stealing, raiding, and sla- unpayed interns)

Well this page will tell you exactly how to get all those precious resources you want.

This here is a drill:

But how do you use it?

First things first. You have to connect it to a power source like so:

Now that it has a power source you need a way of moving the drill to actually mine stuff. For this step you have to make it into a ship. For a simple fast miner building a carbyn shell around the drill and power-bank with a small viewing port will serve your recource hungry needs like so:

Next you have to make it a ship by placing down a ship computer and detecting it. Having an onboard storage connected to the small storage of the drill is also a good idea for long mining trips. To use the drill you must pilot the ship and then right click the sign of the drill. It should look like this before right clicking it:

and like this after right clicking it:

The picture above, of course, should say the name of the person who right clicked the drill.

Next step is you just ram it into any ston wall you can find, the area of x blocks by x blocks will be mined out by the layer touching the glass of the drill here:

The area it mines is dependent on the block tier of the drill. Consult wiki page Drill for more drill information about tiers, mining area, etc.

Turrets
Turrets are multiblock structures useful for larger ships and base defense platforms. You can put them on starships and they work even while it's flying. They have more firepower than even TNT per energy bolt and can make a big difference in the hands of a skilled and well-fortified gunner. Their multiblocks are a bit larger and more complicated then usual, so the screenshots include broken-down versions

To create the sign, it must be directly below (or above, if it's an upside-down turret) the center of the sponge blocks under the turret, 2 blocks down, and say the axis on the second line (e.g. "top" or "bottom"). The first line must say [turret].

Light Turret
Good for small or medium ships, and for precise anti-player shots, these turrets fire one single heavy energy projectile that move exactly where the player is looking.

Multiblock
Materials required: 1x sponge, 1x concrete, 3x terracotta, 7x stairs, 1x iron block, 2x glass, 2x stained glass

Heavy Turret
Good for medium to large ships and for anti-ship heavy defense, these turrets are larger and slightly more expensive, but pack twice the firepower. However, they are less accurate.

Multiblock
Materials required: 3x sponge, 8x concrete, 13x stairs, 4x terracotta, 1x iron block, 2x glass, 4x stained glass

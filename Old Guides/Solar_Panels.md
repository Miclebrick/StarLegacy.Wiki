Solar Panels
Solar Panels are devices which you can use to generate power passively. They do not require fuel, however they only work when the daylight sensor is powered (or, if it's an inverted daylight sensor, then when it's not powered.)

They are built with a workbench, diamond block, and daylight sensor stacked like so:

Each sensor generates an average of five power per second.

Here is an example of a panel system: b17d40ddd8f133273ccc762414b5c457.jpg Note that it has a loose end, you can put a looped wire on that end or another power output wire to increase it's efficiency due to power pathfinding mechanism: adf5e4deb45406e3ae7f81bb083212dc.png

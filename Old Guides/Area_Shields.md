Area Shields
Area Shields are passive shields, similar to starship particles shields, which are always active and use erudition power.

Note: These will ONLY work on bases, they will not work on ships.
They protect from all explosions within their radius. The radius is projected from the sign. A 5 block radius one is just large enough to fit a heavy turret if you put the center of the sponge blocks of the heavy turret on top of the sign. The power usage per explosion is the amount of blocks exploded.

To use an area shield, simply build the multiblock, right click the sign to create it, and fill it up with power. (See automation power machines and wires)

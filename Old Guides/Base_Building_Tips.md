Base Location
Bases, bases, bases. From large sky scrapers to underground bunkers, bases take many shapes and sizes. But where do you put such a base? The first step is choosing a planet. There are many planets in the 4 solar systems in Star Legacy, and choosing the right solar system to head to can be the difference between living next to certain death or a relatively peaceful area. Next is the planet to choose from. There are a wide variety of different planets ranging from cold icy planets to inferno hell like planets to lush tropical island planets. Choosing the one for you is very important because you�ll probably be staying there a while.

Once you have found the solar system and planet of your choosing, you want to head there right away. Looking at the map is very helpful in not just finding a planet, but also finding a place to settle in. Looking over the planet, find a nice, unclaimed area that will suit your needs. (Joining a settlement, however, will be much easier to get a good foot hold on a planet) Once you have landed on the ground, find a place to put your crappy first survival house. In that house, having a cry-pod and storage is crucial. If you are unable to buy the claim, try claiming it with Grief Prevention, this will keep your valuables safe from unwanted guests.

Base Planning
By now you should start setting up a temporary mini base. This is a base that is covered completely with an area-shield. Here you want to start making your temporary machine layouts. Mining is very important to do before hand to have the right amount of resources to get a head start on your machines. Creating a system to make armored blocks, using a printer, and a system to make carbyne, using a printer connected to carbon processor, is very important to get some materials to make your base. These materials are also very useful in ship building. At this point you should also create a heavy turret emplacement which is also covered by the area-shield. This is what you think is a good turret here:

...but you�re WRONG. This turret is unprotected, exposed, and is very easy for enemy to turret kill you. To properly arm your turret you will need preferably iron bars and a stone slab, but for beginners glass pains and any slab will do fine for now. This is done by placing the iron bars and slab as shown in the below:

As you can see in the picture above the turret is protected by the iron bars to block enemy fire from glitching through the turret multi-block and killing you.

Next you want to start planning out how your base will look. When doing this you want to think about building placements and marking them with temporary marker blocks that are easy to see in the custom terrain of the planet you picked. When planning your base you also want to plan your base-defense at the same time.

Base Defense
To create a good base-defense you want to plan out turret placements, area-shield placements and find the middle of your base. Turret placements should be as follows: -Elevated area -As much view of the sky and surrounding area as possible -Connected with entrances into turrets only possible to get into if you are part of the settlement

Under all of the turrets you want an area-shield connected to a power-bank connected to a separate power grid. This will make sure that an area-shield isn't taking all the energy from your base stopping things like printers and processors to work. This is also better because the energy system is very... difficult and doesn't work the way you want it to. The best source of energy would most likely be solar panels. A perfect 100% efficient set up of a solar array is as follows:

Note: The row of solar panels and sponge line can be extended as far as you want:

This is also stackable side ways. To do this add a sponge behind the two iron blocks connecting the solar-panel and sponge line and placing an end rod behind the sponge and and iron block behind that. Then create a sponge line connecting the two iron blocks and place solar-panels on either side:

The end rods leaving the iron block is the output of energy from this system. This should then connect to a power bank which then connects to an area shield as so:

From the power-bank you want to connect it to the area shield. This area shield should be placed inside your base where the enemy cannot see it. This area shield should cover the turret above it and the area around it. The set up is as follows:

ff72447ab805a005b899e4e3c6bd9436.png

The turret should then be placed either on top of the area shield or near the area-shield so it can be protected:

The area shield also doesn't have to be above ground or right under the turret. The solar panels also cannot be under anything so they can receive light from the sun and make energy. You can build a building around the area-shield and power-bank or have the solar-panels on one side of the base the power-bank on the other and the area-shield on the other, but they all have to be connected with one single wire, turning twisting doesn't matter, from the iron block from solar panels to the note block of the power-bank, from the crafting-table of the power-bank to the note block of the area-shield.

You shouldn't just have one of these systems. You should have multiple scattered all over the base. These turrets also should all be thought of as one system. Each individual turret, for a good base defense, should be able to cover all the others. You don't want on on one side of the wall and one on the other because they are separate and the enemy can focus their fire on one of the turrets blow it up and go to the next. (this is how ever pretty hard to do in its-self) (but this also gives a chance for the enemy to run and not killed) If the turrets are all capable of covering each other you can have multiple turrets shooting at the same enemy and be much easier to take the enemy down or fend them off.

Ship Defense
Ships can be the game changer in a defense and a them successful offense. For a base defense ship it should have the following characteristics: -Fast -Deals a-lot of damage in a short period of time -Easily printable and not something to cry over if you lose it -Small to be harder to hit

How to use Base Ship Defenses
A ship factory should be placed in a location where it is protected and the ship made inside can be easily detected and flown out into battle fast.

During an attack the enemy will most likely maneuver around and bombard you with turrets, heavy weapons if possible, and pulse spamming. If they come in an overwhelming ship or massive numbers its better to fight in turrets and get some of them down or get their shields very low. During this turret fight if the enemy begins to retreat due to low shields you jump into a star-fighter made for long distance and good armor and shield and fly after them and kill them as your ground turrets have dealt massive damage to their shield it wouldn't be difficult with a good enough pilot to take them down. If the enemy is overwhelming its better for some to fight in turrets and some to fly in base defense ships and deal massive damage in a small time to the enemy. This is done by flying around them, shooting a salvo of everything you have, then dodging their heavy fire until you get another chance to shoot at them. This will confuse and draw fire from the enemy to the small base-defense ships so the turrets on the ground can regenerate their area shield power and keep firing.

With all of the things said above your base will be well defended and a force to be reckoned with. Have fun and enjoy what Star Legacy has to offer.

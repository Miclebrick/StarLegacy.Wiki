Starship Weaponry
There are many weapons available to shipwrights wanting to arm their builds. Weapons typically require power, which is provided from the starship's power output. They do large amounts of damage, although this can be absorbed using particle shields.

There are two different weapon types: light weapons and heavy weapons. To fire light weapons, hold a clock in your hand and press left mouse button. To fire heavy weapons, hold a clock in your hand and hold down the right mouse button for about 1 second.

Laser Cannons

Materials required: 1x sponge, 1x piston

Laser cannons are your most basic weapons. They use 1000 power per shot and have a range of 300 blocks. Their projectiles move straight forward and have an explosion power of 2.0. They can break armor, but not by much. Laser Cannons count as light weapons.

Pulse Cannons

Materials required: 1x sponge, 1x stained glass

Pulse cannons are low powered weapons which, although the cannot breach armor, are useful for dealing small repeated damage to shields, using on larger ships, and killing players with. They are fully aimable but have low range and a 1.75 explosion power. They use 500 power per shot and have a range of 200 blocks. NOTE: The color of pulse cannons is based on the stained glass. Pulse Cannons count as light weapons.

Plasma Cannons

Materials Required: 1x sponge, 1x iron block, 1x furnace

Plasma cannons are like laser cannons but much more powerful. You can only have a few of them on ships. They use 1000 power per shot and you can only fire 4 at a time (This is subject to change). They have an explosion power of 4.0, equivalent to TNT. Plasma Cannons count as light weapons.

Proton Torpedoes

Materials required: 2x sponge, 1x dispenser

Proton torpedoes are heavy weapons useful for smaller ships. You can only have a few on any ship, even ones with high power output. You fire them by holding or double clicking right click. They have an explosion power of 8.0 and a range of 300 blocks. They are most effective when spaced apart. Torpedoes count as heavy weapons.

Heavy Lasers

Materials required: 7x redstone block, 28x stained glass (any color), 1x furnace

Heavy lasers are powerful weapons useful for larger ships. They create ten 3.0 power explosions on impact, with approximately 150 milliseconds in between. They use 5000 power per shot, although they use a bit less the bigger your ship is, and have a maximum range of 500 blocks. They are primarily useful on larger ships when fighting against other large ships. Heavy Lasers count as heavy weapons.

NOTE: Furnace is the FRONT of the weapon
Auto Turrets

Materails required: 1x dispenser, 1x iron block, 1x redstone lamp.

Auto turrets are mainly useful for ships that are too big to maneuver and shoot down smaller ships. They do not have a rapid enough rate of fire and consume too much power to have many of on small ships, so they are only truly useful on big ships. They are very effective on a cruiser firing against starfighters and corvettes. They have a range of 200 blocks, explosion power of 2.0, and power usage of 100. They are also primarily defensive weapons - if you move around or fire other weapons, they can't fire as much, and they have difficulty hitting moving targets. NOTE: If you put a dye in the dispenser, then it uses that as the color of the shot. The dispenser must also be facing into the iron block.

NOTE: The redstone lamp is where the auto turret fires from
To set up auto turrets you need [node] signs. Place a sign on the dispenser that says, for example:

line 1 [node]

line 2 defense

Then, you can do /settarget defense <player>

You can also turn heavy turrets into auto heavy turrets. To do this, simply place a node sign on the turret sign, like so: oyKvb_ecSYSumhBepC-80A.png

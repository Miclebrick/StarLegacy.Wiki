There are various classes of starships which have unique stats, such as block size, power output per second, and dropper percentages.

Red = Colonist Primary Ships, Blue = Pirate/Privateer Primary Ships.

These ships are unlocked by ranking up. You unlock the tier ship of your ranktrack and the tier under it of the other.

Ex, If you get T2 colonist, you would have unlocked the T2 colonist ship, and T1 privateer/pirate ship.

NOTE: The minimum hull block (concrete) percentage, for all ships, is 30% NOTE: Chest = to 3 storage. Dispenser/Dropper = 1

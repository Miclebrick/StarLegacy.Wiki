Starship Drills
Starship drills are drills that you can mount on starships and use to mine large areas very fast. They require a constant stream of power to work. When you right click the sign, it enables the drill. Then, after redetecting, pilot your ship, fly forward, and it will begin to break blocks in front of it, depending on the tier.

As of now, these DO drill through liquid. However, this may be changed, and the wiki will be updated accordingly.

Drill Sizes:
Tier 1: 5x5 hole
Tier 2: 7x7 hole
Tier 3: 9x9 hole
The drill doesn't move by itself - you need to mount it on a starship and move the starship.

Multiblock
Materials required: 1x furnace, 1x dropper, 1x noteblock, 1x redstone block, 1x redstone lamp, 2x tier block, 4x glass pane, 1x glass, 1x sign

Tier Blocks:

Tier 1: Iron Block
Tier 2: Diamond Block
Tier 3: Emerald Block
(It is important to note that the diamond block is tier 2 and the emerald block is tier 3. This is unlike the power machines, where gold is tier 2 and diamond is tier 3. Don't mix it up!)

The sign must read [drill], and when clicked will automatically assign the correct tier.

Furthermore, you must place 2 focus lens into the drills furnace. Place 1 in the top and the other in the bottom. WIthout it, it will not work!

Starship Production
Starship Production begins with a design for a ship. This can be made in a singleplayer world, a build server, or even in survival on the server itself. Then, people usually copy it over to survival using a mod called schematica. You can also hand-build it. After you have built your perfect ship, you can then save it using blueprints. Blueprints are files that get stored and let you save a copy of your starship so that you can rebuild it even if your original copy gets destroyed! You can also use this functionality to make mass-producing factories.

The /blueprint Command
To manage blueprints, you use /blueprint. To save or create a blueprint, you must first be piloting a ship. Then, come up with a name for it. Then, do /blueprint save <name>. Now you can do /blueprint list to see your blueprints, or you can do /blueprint info <name> to see a detailed list of what materials are required to build it. If you would like to remove your blueprint, do /blueprint delete <name>.

Making Your Own Ship
The first ship you start with is a Speedy and this can be deconstructed block by block until there is nothing left. For a ship to be able to fly and be fully functional it requires the following.

A Starship Computer
30% of all blocks must be White Carbyne (There are other Carbyne's)
Tier 1 Thurster (Don't block the thruster's output. Imagine placing a slab of metal so it covered the output of a jet planes jet engine.. Why on earth.)
A sign with [helm]
Now as a refugee you are limited to 100 blocks max for your first ship and you cannot go over. Don't make the same mistake I made and build an entire ship without putting into consideration my maximum block limit!

100 Blocks is not much at all, to get 500 blocks and more you must visit Apply Here

Now after making your application and building a ship within the refugee block limit, be sure to always redetect your ship on any modification made to the ship. It doesn't matter if you've added a torch, this must be redetected. Now after redetecting and receiving green text (If you haven't follow red instructions) test whether or not the ship flys. If it flys, save it. Do this by using the command /blueprint save CHANGE_ME_TO_NAME_OF_YOUR_SHIP

(IMPORTANT: You must be piloting the ship first before using the blueprint command!)

Starship Factories
Starship Factories are what make blueprints truly useful - you can use them to easily replicate any blueprint you have saved!

To make one, you must create the starship factory multiblock (as shown below). For the sign, put [shipfactory] on the first line and the name of the blueprint on the second line. Note: You can only use blueprints that belong to you. If someone else has a blueprint with the same name, it won't work for you when you create the sign. It should then create the factory sign. You need a focusing lens in the fuel and smelting slot, as with base shields.

Once you have it set up, you must make sure you have all of the required materials in the chest. Also make sure that there is a clear space to the front right of the back of the factory. Finally, you can right click the sign and watch it build your ship automatically!

UPDATE: You can now use ship factories with money instead of items - simply put a gold nugget/ingot/block in the fuel slot, and it will use credits instead. To see the cost do `/blueprint info <blueprint>` and it will tell you before the block distribution. "UPDATE: If a design for a ship does not belong to you and the creator has not given you permission to blueprint it, we will consider this a bannable offense.

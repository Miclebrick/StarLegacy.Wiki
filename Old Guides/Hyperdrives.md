Hyperdrives
Hyperdrives are subsystems that allow you to jump to "hyperspace", a parallel dimension with different laws of physics which allow you to move at extremely high speeds.

To use them, first build a hyperdrive in your starship. Then, fill the hoppers with hypermatter (Chetherite). A hyperspace jump requires 1 hypermatter in each hopper. To actually jump to hyperspace, you must have a means of navigation. The simplest way is to use one of the hyperspace beacons found in every system (to do this, simply fly up to one and click on the button in the chat message it sends you). You can also build and use a navigation computer.

There are 4 classes of hyperdrives. The higher the class, the more hypermatter is required to use them (more hoppers). Higher classes can make you go faster, although they mostly affect larger ships - smaller ships don't get that much of a speed boost using them, but larger ships require them to go at a practical speeds.

Navigation Computers
Navigation computers are subsystems that allow you to plot hyperspace jumps with no hyperdrive beacon nearby. Navcomputers have GUI menus that allow you to pick from a number of methods to plot courses, such as entering coordinates, finding the nearest hyperspace beacon leading to another system, or using pre-programmed routes to get to places. (NOTE: Not all of these are currently implemented)

# Base Shields
Base shields are machines that project a spherical shield to protect bases.
- While active, they generate a sphere of stained glass that regenerates when destroyed.
- They use up a small amount of power when activated, using more power when regenerating.
- With concentrated heavy repeated fire, it is possible to penetrate a base shield.
- However this is generally difficult and requires heavy firepower.
   - Multiple layers of base shields can help against this.

## Activating a base shield:
- Place prismarine crystals in both slots of the furnace.
- Ensure that the shield sign is charged and has power(recieves power through noteblock).
- Right click the sign to set it to "enabled." This should generate a large bubble of stained glass.
- When the power runs out, or disabled with another right click, the glass will disappear shortly.

## Multiblocks
The sign for the base shields is [baseshield].

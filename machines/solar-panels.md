# Solar Panels

Solar Panels are devices which you can use to generate power passively, without fuel.
- They only work when the daylight sensor is powered
  - On planets, they do not generate power when inverted.
  - In Space, they must be inverted to generate power.
- Each sensor generates an average of five power per second.

They are built with a workbench, diamond block, and daylight sensor stacked like so:

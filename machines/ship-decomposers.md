# Ship Decomposers

Ship decomposers allow for the easy disassembly of any starship or other pilotable structures.
- Ship decomposers require power to operate, holding a max of 75k power
- Ship decomposers can extend 100 blocks in each direction, a 100x100x100 at its largest for one decomposer
- Ship decomposers can only break pilotable blocks

## Multiblock

Ship Decomposers are built with a chest(can be a double), a note block, an iron block, as well as `chisled` blocks. **(Note: Only quartz works at this time)**

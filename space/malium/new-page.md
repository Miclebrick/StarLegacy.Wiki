## Quick Notes

Rolling hills dotted with trees and bushes, Collis is an excellent place to settle for new players. With its general safe environment(apart from the packs of spiders that will attack during the day in some places), it is a good place for new players to learn the basic mechanics of the server. The major ruling group of Collis is the Kingdom of Luxivitas focused mainly in the Northeast corner with their capital as a Trade City. Although low in ores, Collis is a world good for its farming, magma and lava farming, and string collecting. Collis is also one of the few worlds with nearly all(if not, all) passive mobs including cows, pigs, sheep, and more.

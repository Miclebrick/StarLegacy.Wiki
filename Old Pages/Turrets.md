# Turrets
Turrets are multiblock structures useful for larger ships and base defense platforms.

## Using Turrets:
- With a controller in hand, right click the turret sign.
- Once inside, simply looking around rotates and aims the turret.
- Left click with the controller to fire!
- To exit, just right click.

*Creating A Turret Sign:*
- Must be directly below (or above) the center of the sponge blocks under the turret. 
- 2 blocks below (or above)
- The first line must say [turret].
- The second line needs the axis (e.g. "top" or "bottom").

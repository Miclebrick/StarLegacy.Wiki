# Printers
*Printers* are machines that turn cobblestone and energy into various materials.

## Using a printer:
-  Ensure the sign has power (accepts power through noteblock).
- Then, put a focusing lens (prismarine crystals) in the top slot.
- Next, put cobblestone in the fuel slot.
- The printer should now begin converting.

## Printer Multiblock 

- Red blocks are replaced with the **machinery blocks**.
- The blue block is replaced with the **core block**.
- The white block is replaced with the **product block**.

## Carbon Processor

*Carbon processors* simply process raw concrete powder into concrete.

Using a carbon processor is the same as a printer.
- Except that you must use graxene(concrete) powder rather than cobblestone.

> The color of the product is determined by the color of the stained glass in the center.

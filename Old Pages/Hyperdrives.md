# Hyperdrives
Hyperdrives allow faster-than-lightspeed travel, drastically cutting travel time.

## Use
- First, build a hyperdrive in your starship. 
- Then, fill the hoppers with Chetherite (minimum 1 per hopper). 
### *Navigating a jump can be done one of two ways:*
- Use one of the hyperspace beacons found in every system.
> To do this, simply fly up to one and click on the button in the chat message it sends you.
- You can also build and use a navigation computer [(Info here)].

# Tiers
- There are 4 classes of hyperdrives.
- The higher the class, the more hypermatter is required to use them (more hoppers). 
- Higher classes can make you go faster, although the effect is greater for larger ships.

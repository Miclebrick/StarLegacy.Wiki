# Navigation Computers

Navigation computers are subsystems for starships used to plot hyperspace jumps without a hyperspace beacon.
Their main disadvantage is that their range is limited: they can only go a dozen or two thousand blocks.
This limits their usage primarily to in-system usage, particularly for the basic one.

There are two types of navigation computers: *basic*, and *advanced*.

Basic navigation computers can only jump 10,000 blocks at a time, meaning it
would take 4-8 jumps to get to another system, depending on the distance.

Advanced navigation can jump 25,000 blocks at a time, meaning it would take
a few jumps to get to another system.

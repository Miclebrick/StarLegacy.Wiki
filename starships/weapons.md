# Starship Weapons

Starships can (and should!) have weapons to defend themselves.
There is a variety of types of starship weapons.
This page walks you through them.

## Firing Weapons

Weapons can be either light or heavy weapons.
**Light weapons** are fired by left clicking with a starship controller.
**Heavy weapons** are fired by right clicking with a starship controller.

## Weapon Types

### Laser Cannons

The simplest starship weapon is the laser cannon.
Laser cannons fire towards the targetted block,
with a firing cone of 15 degrees, a single explosion on impact,
and linear power usage.
They fire yellow projectiles.

supply ammunition to them.

#### Auto Turrets

Auto turrets can target players and shoot at them automatically.
They are very effective on a cruiser firing
against starfighters and corvettes.
They are also primarily defensive weapons -
if you move around or fire other weapons, they can't fire as much,
and they have difficulty hitting moving targets.

The redstone lamp is where the auto turret fires from.
To set up auto turrets you need [node] signs.
Place a sign on the dispenser that says, for example:

> Line 1: [node]
>
> Line 2: defense

Then, you can do `/settarget defense <player>`

> Alternatively, you can use `/st` instead of `/settarget`

You can also turn heavy turrets into auto turrets.
To do that, place a node sign on the turret sign, like this:

#### Auto Turret Details

>
> **Range** *200 Blocks*
>
> **Type** *Neither; Auto Weapon*
>
> **Impact** *1x explosion, power 2.0*

#### Node Signs

Node signs are used to divide weapons into weaponsets.
To set up a node sign, type 
> Line 1: [node]
>
> Line 2: \<weaponset name\>
  
 If the weaponset consists of turrets or auto turrets,
 you can fire them automatically with:
 
> /settarget \<set name\> \<target\>
> or /st with the same arguments.
  
 If the weaponset contains manual weapons,
 to take control you need a sign like this:
 
> Line 1: [weaponset]
>
> Line 2: \<weaponset name\>
 
 Clicking the sign will let you take control
 of the selected weaponset.

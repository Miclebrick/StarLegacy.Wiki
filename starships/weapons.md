# Starship Weapons

Starships can (and should!) have weapons to defend themselves.
There is a variety of types of starship weapons.
This page walks you through them.

## Firing Weapons

Weapons can be either light or heavy weapons.
**Light weapons** are fired by left clicking with a starship controller.
**Heavy weapons** are fired by right clicking with a starship controller.

## Weapon Types

### Plasma Cannons

Plasma cannons are like laser cannons but much more powerful.
You can only have a few of them on ships.

#### Auto Turrets

Auto turrets can target players and shoot at them automatically.
They are very effective on a cruiser firing
against starfighters and corvettes.
They are also primarily defensive weapons -
if you move around or fire other weapons, they can't fire as much,
and they have difficulty hitting moving targets.

#### Auto Turret Multiblock

> * `1x Redstone Lamp`
> * `1x Iron Block`
> * `1x Dispenser`

<a href="https://imgur.com/RGmqHkn"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RGmqHkn.png" title="Auto Turret Cross Section" /></a>

#### Auto Turret Details

> **Power Usage** *100 per shot per cannon*
>
> **Range** *200 Blocks*
>
> **Type** *Neither; Auto Weapon*
>
> **Impact** *1x explosion, power 2.0*

The redstone lamp is where the auto turret fires from.
To set up auto turrets you need [node] signs.
Place a sign on the dispenser that says, for example:
> Line 1: [node]
>
> Line 2: defense

Then, you can do `/settarget defense <player>`

> Alternatively, you can use `/st` instead of `/settarget`

You can also turn heavy turrets into auto turrets.
To do that, place a node sign on the turret sign, like this:

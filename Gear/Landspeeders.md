# Landspeeders

Landspeeders are hoverbikes that allow you to go across land at high speeds; they require fuel to run and burn though it quickly. There are three tiers of Landspeeder. However, only the lowest tier is obtainable.

## Obtaining a Landspeeder
Landspeeders are obtained from /kit starter and item drops when ranks are purchased. They are currently uncraftable.

## Using a landspeeder
Landspeeders are stored in the players inventory in the form of a chest. They display their fuel in the item's lore.

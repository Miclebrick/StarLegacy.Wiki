# New Player Guide

Welcome to Star Legacy! This guide will teach you the basics of getting started on the server. To make things easier on you, the new player, the wiki's side navigation bar was organized to help you find anything you need for your ship, starting a base, improving your base, and other basic information. Keep in mind, the wiki only will teach you the basics of the server, more advanced aspects will require you to learn them from other players or becoming self-taught.

## Getting Started
### Basic Gear

- `/kit space` to obtain a space suit to survive the void of space. ***Note that this can be done every 3 hours with no cost each time.***
- `/controller` to obtain a controller(clock) to detect and fly ships as well as finding yourself on the map. ***Note that it costs 100 credits to buy a controller.***
- `/kit starter` gets you all your basic gear to survive the numerous worlds around Libna. ***Note that this can only be used once a week.***

### Ferry System
Star Legacy has a ferry system that takes players between stations located throughout the star systems. To access the ferry from Jadiid, follow the lime carpet out to the Ferry Landing Pad. *Make sure to read the signs along the way*

### Getting Ready to Fly in Star Legacy

#### Learning to Fly
At the board in the main building on Jadiid, follow the yellow carpet to the elevator and follow the instructions posted on the signs.

#### Obtaining Your Own Ship
Follow the purple carpet to the shops, this is where you can sell a variety of resources. **read signs along the way**

Go to the bazaar stand with gray and white wool, that is where the `Ship Dealers` are located. Click on the NPCs to purchase your first ship. **Note, you will be teleported away from the main area of Jadiid in your ship. The ship also costs 200 credits.**

#### Final Preparations
First off, left-click the ship computer with the controller, it will register the computer. When you left-click again, it will pull up a menu with 4 options. Below are the four options and what they allow you to do:
- `Re-detect` is the first option and has the controller icon. This re-detects your ship either after building/purchasing and adds/removes any changes you may have made to the ship. There are a variety of pilotable blocks, so be **extremely** careful when landing a ship around any player-made structure or other ships.

- `Pilots` is the second option and has a head as the icon. This will show any additional players that you have added to the computer. Adding pilots will allow said players to do any function the ship's owner has access to. To add a pilot, click the beacon labeled `Add Pilot`, this will send the chat prompt `Enter player name:`. Simply type the player's name and press enter. ***Be careful who you add as pilot.***

- `Type (SHUTTLE)` is the third option and has a ghast tear as the icon. This allows you to change the class of the ship you are currently flying. The computer will default to the shuttle class. You may not have a need to go into this menu until you hit **Level 12** where you are able to pilot a larger ship class. The three classes you have access to are the Speeder, Shuttle, and Starfighter classes.

- `Lock Disabled` is the fourth option and has an iron door as the icon. This is the ship's lock that disallows everyone but the pilots to access or break the ship. Notice that when you click on it, it changes to `Lock Enabled`. There is a 5 minute wait time for it to lock before your ship is officially safe. To ensure it locks, enable the lock followed by piloting and un-piloting the ship to ensure it starts to lock. A message will appear in the chat when your ship has locked. ***Due to updating the server, ship locks are broken and stealing ships from other players is illegal unless specified else where in the rules***

Detect your ship, a chat message will appear telling you whether or not the detection was successful and how many blocks it detected. Your ship is ready to fly! To pilot it, right-click the ship computer with the controller. A message above your hotbar and a chat message will appear telling you the ship has been activated and how big it is. Your shield strength is listed top and center of your screen giving the name of the shield and its percentage, this only shows while you are actively piloting the ship.

You are ready to begin your adventures in Libna with your new ship!

### Flying in Star Legacy

#### Shift Flying
`Shift` flying allows you to move short distances more precisely, not the main form of flying for long distances since it's slower than other ways of flying. 

In order to shift fly, hold the controller in your and face the direction you wish to fly in; then hold `LEFT SHIFT`(sneak). So as as there's nothing in the way, your ship will move the direction you are facing. You can easily chance the direction by looking another way even while the ship is in motion.

#### Cruising
`Cruising` is used for long distance travel within a system or on a planet. 

There's two ways to cruise. You can place a sign and put `[cruise]` on the first line followed by right-clicking the sign. While piloting the ship, you can right-click the sign to start cruising. To stop, left-click the cruise sign.

The second way to cruise is to look the direction you want to cruise and type `/cruise`. To stop, type the same command again.

Make to have the map open so you can properly navigate while cruising. The direction you are facing is shown on the right side of your screen, use this to effectively navigate since the ship has to slow down if you plan on turning or stopping.

#### Steering
Starships can change directions either with helm signs or two keys binded to steering while piloting.

If you wish to have a helm, place down a sign with `[helm]` on the first line and right-click the sign.
- `Right-click` to turn right.
- `Left-click` to turn left.

You can also turn by using `Q` and `F` to navigate which comes much more in handy when you're not at the bridge or in combat for quick manuevering.
- `Q` to turn right.
- `F` to right left.


#### Tips
- If there's a block in the way of your ship, you can't go that way and need to go a different direction or back up before changing direction around said block. 
- All stained glass blocks act as "hangar doors". You can fly ships through them, and they reappear when it exits them.
- Remember to click on your name on the map again after switching worlds.
- To unpilot your ship, do `/release` or right click the computer.
- To protect your ship, lock it when you're not in friendly territory.

## What's Next
Now that you know the basics of flying a ship and navigating Libna, there are a number of things you can do.

### Join Star Legacy's Discord!
If you wish to join a growing community, ask questions from players with a year or more of experience, and countless other things, you can join Star Legacy's Discord server! Invite link: https://discord.gg/hPwPUMc

### You can make money. 
- Money will allow you to purchase advancements and purchase exp to level up.
- It will allow you to also buy SLXP which is use for leveling yourself up(every 12 levels gets you a larger ship). 
- You can earn money by doing crate missions between Trade Cities/NPC Outposts.
- You can also trade with other players(selling items or ships).
- The most common money earning for new players is mining Oriominum in the Blackular System and selling it at Blackular station.

### Settling Down
- Although not heavily used, you can make a small claim to protect stuff by using `/claim`(expanding it by standing inside and typing `/expandclaim`). For more info, you should check out the tutorial in this [video on YouTube](http://bit.ly/mcgpuser).
- You can create your own settlement once you reach **Level 7**, territories vary in cost depending on size and planet. Stand in the territory and do `/s create [settlement name] [cost]`.
- You can join a pre-existing settlement(that is most likely already in a nation). This is the most encouraged route for new players since you'll have the opportunity to learn from players that have been on the server for quite a long time. Do `/s join [settlement name]` once you recieve an invitation from said settlement. 

### Checking out Other SL Servers
- `/server creative` will take you to the creative server where you can freely design ships or buildings to then print into survival.
- `/server land_legacy` to join the faction-based area of the server. Kill or be killed.
- `/server survival` to return to Star Legacy's survival.

### Donate
You can donate for bigger plots at [the donation store](https://starlegacy.buycraft.net/) or ranks. If you want some inspiration, it is recommended that you go `/warp spaceplots` or `warp betaplots` to see what other people have built.


## Interstellar Travel
### Map
Star Legacy has a web-based map which allows you to view every world, space, and anyone actively holding a clock or flying a ship. To access the map, click [here](https://dynmap.starlegacy.net/) or use `/map` while on the server to get the link.
#### Finding Yourself on the Map
- First, hold the controller you should have. This will make you visible to everyone actively look at the map, but also allows you to find yourself.
- Second, either scan the worlds via the list to find yourself or click on yourself in the bottom right where the players are listed, you may need to scroll through the list of other online players.
- Lastly, once if you find your name, click on it. This will automatically center the map on you if you're holding a clock or piloting a ship.

### Getting to Planets
In the system you start in there are several planets. Open the map (`/map`) and look at the system in the bottom right, where you start. Pick a planet, then fly to its icon. To enter a planet, fly your ship into it.

When you arrive, make sure that you don't land in claimed land - you can't build in claimed land.

### Getting to Neighboring Systems
In other systems, Tenebris and Bellum(for an example), you may find interesting planets with items unavailable in Nexus. 

To get travel to other systems, you will first need a [hyperdrive](https://wiki.starlegacy.net/en/starships/hyperdrives). Hyperdrives use **chetherite** for fuel, which you can get from mining asteroids around Nexus. 

With your hyperdrive and some chetherite(two chetherite per hopper to make one jump), head to one of the **hyperspace beacons** in your system, Nexus only has one beacon. These beacons look like portals on the map. 

To use the beacon, fly very close to the beacon station. When you get close enough, you will get a message saying "accept or deny" the jump to its system.

Once you've unlocked a [navigation computer](https://wiki.starlegacy.net/en/starships/navigation_computer), you can use it to go through hyperspace from and to any point in space. However, you may get caught in mass shadows like dark matter, planets, stars, gravity wells of other players. Navigation computers however have limited range, its range dependant on the size of your starship.

## Cryo Pods
If you're on your own and on a planet, you probably will want to setup a cryopod in either a claim or a safe location. Cryopods allow you to respawn in the cryopod; if you don't have one at the time of death, you will respawn at a station.

Keep in mind you can only have one active cryopod at any given moment. Also if you have your cryopod on your ship, you will not respawn on it if you move the ship after detection. Make sure to detect the cryopod after **every** time you move your ship. Staff will not return you to your ship if this happens to you.

To make one, use `/kit cryo` to get the parts, and see `/info cryopod` for an explanation of building them.

A video tutorial can be found [here](https://youtu.be/EO_HULCRjCg).

### Re-textured blocks
In this server you may encounter several different terms used for blocks and new minerals alike. To maximize your experience, it is recommended to use the provided server resource pack which can also be downloaded offline [from the github](https://github.com/MicleBrick/StarLegacyResourcepack/releases).
Here's an example of blocks which have been re-textured or renamed:

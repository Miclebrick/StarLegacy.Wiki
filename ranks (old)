Meanwhile, you should decide on a rank path ( /ranktrack ). To do this you first need to apply on the forum. Be sure to read the rules. There are three rank paths available: Colonist, Pirate, and Privateer

Colonist: Colonists responsibility is to make money so they can become influential beings in this vast universe and immerse themselves within this community and make a mark in the universe. Colonists make their money mostly by trading, mining, farming, and making Corporations for the marketplace. Colonists advance ranks by earning money (1 credit = 4 points).
Pirates: Pirates responsibility is to attack Colonists with the goal of stealing valuable cargo and other valuable items or properties to make huge fortunes or kill them for points. For Pirates, understanding how the server economy works will help a pirate identify which trades routes will be very busy with traffic. Also Pirates are supposed to develop tactics to attack those who oppose them. Pirates advance ranks by killing players other than refugees (1000-10,000 points) and shooting down their ships (5000-10,000 points).
Privateers: Privateers responsibility are to join settlements/nations full of colonists or form a settlement/nation themselves to make a combat force capable of taking on pirates. They work their hardest to keep everyone safe from pirates. Privateers advance ranks by killing pirates (2000-10,000 points) and shooting their ships down (10,000-20,000 points).
After choosing a rank path, you may now earn points. Points can be used to rank up, unlocking ships classes and making higher tier advancements available to unlocks.

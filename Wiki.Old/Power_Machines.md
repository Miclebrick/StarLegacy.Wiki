Power Machines
Here you will find all you need to know about power machines. The machines covered in this part of the wiki include generators, chargers, and power banks. Wires will be mentioned, but clearly explained here. On this page, you will learn how to create and store power, and how you can use it. NOTE: This power is not to be confused with ship power, which is based on the ship's class and is pre-determined.

Tiers
Tier 1: Iron Block Tier 2: Gold Block Tier 3: Diamond Block

These tier blocks are used in the power machines instead of the iron blocks seen in the pictures. You CANNOT mix different Tier blocks together, this will make the machine not function. (eg. 1 iron block and 1 diamond block in a generator) Tier blocks do not work in other machines unless specified. (eg. Diamond blocks instead of iron in printer)

Furnaces
Generators and Chargers require a furnace. In the top slot of the furnace, you MUST place a focusing lens (prismarine crystal). This allows the machine to operate. Without it, the machine will not work. (Note, the crystals cannot be shift clicked into the slot) In the bottom slot, you place either fuel or the charging item. For example

Generators: Place fuel in the bottom slot and a prismarine crystal in the top slot.
Chargers: Place the power armor or weapon you wish to charge in the bottom slot and the prismarine crystal in the top slot.
Capacities for Generator Tiers
Tier 1 Generator: 100k power
Tier 2 Generator: 175k power
Tier 3 Generator: 250k power
Generator
Generator will burn fuels and gasses and in return create energy. Energy output is from the crafting tables. Connect crafting tables to other machines via sponges and wires.

To use a generator, you put the fuel in the fuel slot, and a focusing lens (prismarine crystals) in the smelting slot.

Charger
Chargers are necessary for charging items such as batteries, blasters, power gear, and more!

To use a charger, you put the focusing lens in the smelting slot and the item to charge in the fuel slot. When it's done smelting it, it will go in the smelted-item slot.

Chargers take in fuel through their noteblock, and must receive it through wires from a generator.

Charger Capacities for Tiers
Tier 1 Charger: 100k
Tier 2 Charger: 200k
Tier 3 Charger: 300k
Multiblock
Materials Required: 1x note block, 8x stained glass pane, 1x furnace, 2x tier block, 1x sign

PowerFurnace
The power furnace will help you with all your smelting needs. Using power, input via note block, it smelts ores into their corresponding gems and other items.

To use a power furnace, place 1 focusing crystal in the fuel slot and the item that needs smelting into the smelting slot.

Multiblock
Materials Required: 1x Sign, 1x Note Block, 1x Furnace, 2x Glass Blocks, 4x Glass Panes, 4x Iron Blocks

For automation the glass used in the multiblock behind the furnace itself and note block can be used as input. The top of the furnace can be used as an output using a crafting table as so. NOTE: The input chest must have a crafting table on the chest, so the chest gives its items into the power furnace, then furnace goes into the other chest, the following multiblock is wrong about this.

Power Bank
Power banks store large amounts of power.

To store power connect the note block with either a sponge or wire, wire or sponge must be connected to power creating source or other power bank with power in it to work. To extract energy use the same method of wires or sponge but connect to the crafting table.

Multiblock
Materials require: 11x stained glass, 8x stained glass pane, 3x redstone block, 2x crafting table, 2x tier block, 1x noteblock, 1x sign

PowerCell
Power cells are a useful buffer for power grids. They can hold up to 50,000 energy and can output 2k per second if wired correctly.

Multiblock
Materials: 1 redstone block, 1 note block, 2 glass panes, 1 sign

To wire correctly power input is into the redstone block behind the note block. For Output place two crafting tables above and below note block with end-rods leaving both in the direction of the sign, from those wires add two sponges one one each and an iron block in-between those two sponges like seen below:

The iron block is the output from PowerCell.

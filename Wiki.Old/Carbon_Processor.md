Carbon Processor
Carbon Processors convert graxene powder (concrete powder) to carbyne (concrete). The color of the resulting carbyne is determined by the color of the stained glass behind the furnace block.

You use a carbon processor the same as a printer, except that you must use graxene powder rather than cobblestone.

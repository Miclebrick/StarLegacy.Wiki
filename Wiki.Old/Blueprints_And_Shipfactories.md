Ship Factory
A ship factory is a machine that automatically builds a ship in front of you.

There are two types of ship factories.

1- Credit Factory 2- Material Factory

NOTE: Both types of factories are made with the SAME multi-block and SAME mechanics.
A Credit Factory, when used, takes credits out of the users bank account and builds a ship using that. Different blocks cost different amounts of credits to make. To change the ship factory into a Credit Factory you must place a golden ingot, block, or nugget in the bottom slot of the furnace and a focusing lens in top slot.

A Material Factory, when used, takes materials out of the chest of the multi-block and prints the ship taking blocks from the chest and placing them down. To change the ship factory into a Material Factory you must place a focusing lens in the bottom AND top slot of the furnace.

Multiblock
Materials: 2 Iron Blocks, 1 Furnace, 1 Sign, 1 Chest

Blueprint
Blueprints are the only way to copy and print ships using a ship factory.

To create a blueprint, fly the ship you wish to copy. Next do the command in game: /blueprint <Blueprint Name> save

It will then ask you to confirm the blueprint so re-do the command in game but add confirm afterwards: /blueprint <Blueprint Name> save confirm

NOTE: All of this must be done FLYING the ship and the SAME blueprint name must be used for the SAME ship you wish to copy.
Blueprint + Ship Factory
To add a blueprint to a factory you must have the blueprint SAVED. To check if you have saved a blueprint or to check what blueprints you have do the command, in game: /Blueprint List

This will yield you a list of all your blueprints and how many blocks the blueprinted ship is.

For the sign of the ship factory, on the SECOND line, you must place the EXACT blueprint name that YOU have saved. Then right click the sign and right click it again to print.

NOTE: You must have plenty of space for the ship factory to print the ship. The space has to be cleared in front of it, and to the right, and above it. The picture below shows the area where the ship factory will print.

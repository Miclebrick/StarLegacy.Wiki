Gravity Well Projectors
Gravity Wells are a small area that has a massive gravitational force, the kind that would make Sir Isaac Newton develop Brain damage from that apple.

Gravity Well Projectors can create mass shadows in hyperspace and pulse a powerful gravity-manipulating wave that freezes all cruising ships other than your own within 500 blocks. They're very useful for pirates, as you can interdict people along trade routes and freeze people while chasing them!

How to Use
Gravity well projectors are a Starship addition, you build the multiblock on your ship. To toggle between on and off, right click the sign.

Gravity wells will pull people out of hyperspace, but at the cost of 10,000 power per second, when enabled. While a Grav Well is on, you can "pulse" it to stop cruising ships in a 3,000 block radius. To pulse, just left click the sign while its toggled on.

While your gravity well projector is enabled, nobody within 3,000 blocks can jump to hyperspace.

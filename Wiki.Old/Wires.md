Wires
Wires are similar to pipes, except they transfer power between machines. You'll need end rods to make wires (special recipe for end rods shown below) and technical blocks (sponges) for turning corners.

The power moves through the end rods, and if it ends up coming into contact with a noteblock of a valid machine, it transfers power to it

Wire Logics
There are many relevant blocks for power transfer.

Noteblock
There is a note block on every power machine multiblock. They are used for power input. Extractors also extract from them.

Extractor
Many power machine multiblocks have these. Unlike noteblocks, though, they don't actually need to be part of the multiblock - you can just place one next to any noteblock part of a valid machine and it'll extract from it. The more extractors you have in a chunk, the less they are ticked, but you should make use of every single extractor on your machines because they tick whether they are used or not. Their block is a crafting table. They can extract into wires and connectors.

Wire
Wires are the fastest and best for simple long distance power transfer. They can only go straight forward. They can take power from iron/redstone blocks, connectors, extractors, and other wires. They can give power to any of the above plus noteblocks and minus extractors.

(In the above example, 100% of power will go to the noteblock on the right)

Connectors
Also known as sponge blocks, these blocks are like wires except they can go into blocks next to them, and they can't take power from iron blocks. However, they can still give power to iron blocks.

(In the above example, the power will be split between the noteblocks on the right and left, coming from the one on the top)

Iron/Redstone Blocks
These are like sponge blocks, but with a few key differences. They cannot give power to sponges and they can't take power from extractors. They also give power to the block opposite of the direction they took power from if one is available.

Connecting Everything
End-Rods can be connected together with the use of sponges to twist and turn the entire wire length. Example:

For directional needs iron blocks may be used. Iron blocks, when inputed energy, will not let it pass into sponges. This means you can have a set up such as this:

In this diagram if energy is imputed from the right side the energy will flow into the sponge, then the iron block, and out the left side end-rods. This is good when having a long wire or multiple wires to converge on one area.

Input
For all machines the input block is a note block:

Extractors
For all machines the crafting table is the extractor:

You can extract power from powercells, powerbanks, and generators. For example in the powerbank and the generator there is this set up in the multiblock:

As you can see above the output wire is being connected to the extractor which is the crafting table. You can then take that wire from the extractor and feed it into another generator such as this:

Note: The videos above pictures staring the extractor and input, crafting table and note block, are not part of any machine. They do not work separately alone, the abve pictures are just so it is easier for the viewer, you, to see the connection between the blocks with more ease.

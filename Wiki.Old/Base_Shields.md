Base Shields
Base shields are machines for protecting bases. They use up a small amount of power while activated and they use up more power when some of its shield gets destroyed and it regenerates it. While active, they generate a sphere of stained glass that regenerates when destroyed. With concentrated heavy repeated fire, it is possible to penetrate a base shield, however this is generally difficult and requires heavy firepower. Multiple layers of base shields can help against this.

To activate a base shield, put prismarine crystals in the fuel slot and the smelting slot of the furnace, make sure that the shield sign is charged and has power, and right click the sign to set it to "enabled." This should generate a large bubble of stained glass. When the power runs out, the glass will dissipate over a few seconds.

By buying cargo crates for cheap in one system and selling them at another, you can make good amounts of profit. You get cargo crates from vendor booths at eco stations. It is recommended that you already have a cargo ship with auto loaders and/or auto unloaders, several double chests (at least two is recommended), and a hyperdrive.

To load cargo crates in your ship, you should hook it up with a loading pipe. Ship loaders need to use red pipes while unloaders use lime pipe. For an example of auto loading systems, see the spawn cargo (colonist) ships from tier 2+ (starting with the heavy shuttle).

Cargo crates are cheap in export systems and sell for more in import systems. Here is a table of their prices.

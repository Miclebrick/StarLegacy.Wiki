Pipes
Pipes are useful tools that allow you to efficiently and neatly transport and organize items. You can use pipes for managing factories and furnace systems and for unloading/loading material onto ships.

Exporting
To export items using pipes, you need a hopper and an exporting inventory, and a glass pipe system. You can point the hopper into a glass pipe, and items attempting to enter the hopper via the inventory block above it will instead stay in the inventory block and attempt to go through the pipe system.

If items go in the chest on the top left of the image, then they will come out in the chest on the bottom right.

Glass Pipes
Glass pipes are used to make long and potentially complicated systems. Glass pipes attempt to put items into inventory blocks next to them if available and also move onto connected pipes. If there are two possible directions for them to go, they pick randomly, which generally ends up in evenly spreading out the items.

Stained Glass Pipes
If you use stained glass pipes, then the pipes don't mix with stained glass pipes of other colors even if they are touching.

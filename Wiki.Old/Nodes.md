Nodes are a tool that allows you to have more control over large ships. They also allow for more precise weapon strikes, without overloading the power of your ship and slowing you weapon systems firing speed. The sign for a node is simply: [node] with whatever you would like to name that weapon set on the second line. In order for your nodes to actually function, you will need to add a Weapon Set, which the sign for is: [weaponset] with the CORRESPONDING node its meant to control. on the second line.

               [main]       [main]

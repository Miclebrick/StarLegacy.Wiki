Overview
Blacktopia is a nation with a government similar to that of the United States with presidential elections every so often and the ability to overthrow the president at any time. Blacktopia is mainly neutral but is not afraid to declare war. But since it is relatively peaceful nation they hope to remain neutral for as long as possible.

History

Blacktopia broke off from the Aztec Collective long ago and became a Monarchy where BlackcloneYT (Blackclone Gaming) was the king of Blacktopia for a long time. Low population levels became a problem. Blacktopia was suffering from a labor shortage. When news of Qusmubia's troubles was heard, King Blackclone offered the hand to their leader, Netherman. Netherman accepted the offer and Blacktopia soon annexed Qusmubia within a day. Blacktopia was reformed to have a hierarchy of territories. Settlements formed commonwealths, which then formed the nation itself. Netherman still controls the Qusmubian commonwealth. After that, Blacktopia reformed its political system, changing from monarchy to republic. In the capital of Blacktopia (also known as Topiary), a celebration was due. In the new political system, the President.is Elected every so often to be the new leader of Blacktopia. BlackcloneYT, who was the president at the time, Stepped down Due to mental health issues at that time (Depression) The 2nt President Doctor_Fishtix. Was able to Further Unify Blacktopia much more. Under the Fish administration, significant progress has been observed. Blackclone is still seen as a Head figure of Blacktopia from his Monarchy years. And brings truth to the tables at many conversations. Soo kinda like Queen Elizabeth is still the head figure of the United Kingdom. it's the same with Blacktopia. Except he has power when elections are going on for a smooth transition of power. But durring the transition of powers, the Fish administration Couped the Discord server.

Starship Entrances
Boarding Ramps
Boarding ramps can be opened or shut only from inside of the ship. To use a boarding ramp, apply a sign with "[boardingramp]" in the first line and right-click to activate. Right-click on the sign opens or closes the ramp. When the ramp is opened, the block under the sign will be removed, the block behind the removed block will be lowered by 1, and the rest will be unaltered. Any blocks can be used for this setup. Boarding ramps come pre-installed on some ships purchasable at eco stations. 683vw7K.png

Docking Tubes
Docking tubes lets you dock with stations or other ships. To make one you need an oak or iron door. Other doors work fine but would not attach to your ship. Place stone buttons around the door's side. Place a sign on the door with "[dockingtube]" in the first line and right-click to activate. Only one end of the docking tube needs the sign. Remember to activate docking tube only after unpiloting your ship. qvge7ou.png scOGC26.png Docking doors can be found at eco stations and especially at export/import shops. Docking tubes come pre-installed on some ships purchasable at eco stations.

Tractor Beam
On big ships like cruisers, landing may seem quite impossible, especially on planets with a lot of vegetation or structures on its surface. A tractor beam transports the player straight down from the ship without needing to land. To use a tractor beam, place a glass block and surround it with slabs. Place a sign on one of the slabs with "[tractorbeam]" in the first line and right-click to activate. You should have an upside-down half slab three blocks above the glass to avoid suffocation damage. The blocks under the glass need to be air. To use a tractor beam, have a clock in your hand and while standing on the glass block right-click the sign. To beam up, look up and right-click with a clock while standing under the glass block. Tractor beams come pre-installed on some ships purchasable at eco stations. Below is an example of two tractor beams, one with bottom-half slabs and the other with top-half slabs. yHcaDmq.png

Airlocks
Are doors looking a little to antiquated for your high tech ship/base? Well hop on by Rayshielding Solution Inc. to buy our latest in rayshieldig technology, the airlock! This structure is a fine replacement for that bland old door. This mutiblock consists of 6 iron blocks, 2 iron bars, and a sign(or two if you'd like). An image is show below visualizing how to build it. To activate the structure, write [airlock] on the sign and right-click it when finished building. Keep in mine that the sign has to be on the left side of the structure. You can toggle the door by clicking the sign. While it is on, the iron bars are replaced by nether portal blocks to give a rayshield door effect. You can pass through it in this state. iDWFKfz.png

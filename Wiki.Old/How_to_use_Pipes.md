Containers
Containers store items. Examples of containers are Chests, Trapped chests, Droppers, Dispensers, Hoppers. Hoppers DO NOT work as extractors so they cannot be use to take items out of other storage containers and place them into pipes. Ender chests are also incapable of being used with pipes or extractors.

Extractor
The only extractor on Star Legacy is the crafting table, which looks like this:

The extractor takes items out of storage containers and into pipes.

Pipes
Pipes can be in the form of a glass pain line or full glass block line. Different colored glass pains and full blocks when used in as pipes when touching they will not mix. For example if you have a green line on one side and a red line on the other side and they are touching with no blocks in-between the items going through red will not interfere and will not go into the line of green.

Set up
To set up a pipe system you need a crafting table, glass (regular/stained) or glass pains (regular/stained), and two separate containers. This is an example of a correctly made pipe system:

In the set up above, an output chest is connected to two input chests, making it so when an item goes in the output chest, it travels into one of the input chests. This is an example of the same system except using glass pains instead of full glass blocks:

Sorting System
Using all this information we can create an automatic, fast, no red-stone, sorting system.

To make a sorting system you will need the following items: -Hopper -Glass Pain (3 different colors) -Chest & Trapped chest -Crafting Table -Item to be sorted -Item for FILLER

To begin construction plan out the area you will want first before following these steps. You will want to plan after looking through the pictures and steps of how to make your sorting system below.

Place down a chest and a crafting table next to it.
Connect and make a pipeline to the crafting table.
Make a second pipeline one block away from the first, so they aren't touching.
Make a row of hoppers between the two pipelines, facing the second.
Place down a row of alternating chests and trapped chests on the other side of the second pipeline.
This should look something like this:

NOTE: They can be any colors you wish, as long as they are different from each other.
The hoppers are used for the actual sorting. You need to place the items you want in the corresponding chest in the hopper, and then use a filler item(an item to fill empty slots) in the rest of the slots to prevent random items appearing in the chest. Remember that a single hopper can only hold 5 items. Example:

The Snowballs are the filler item, and the brick, wheat, and sugar cane count as the sorting items.

NOTE: The filler in the system has to be an item that would NEVER flow through your system. To make sure it doesn't name the item using an anvil.

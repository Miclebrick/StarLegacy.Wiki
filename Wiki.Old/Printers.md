Printers do what alchemists couldn't - convert cobblestone into other blocks! You can use printers to generate carbyne (concrete/ship hull blocks), technical blocks (sponges), armor (terracotta/stained clay), and glass.

To use the printer, ensure the sign has power. Then, put a focusing lens (prismarine crystals) in the top slot. Then, put cobblestone in the fuel slot. The printer should now begin converting.

You replace the red blocks with the "machinery blocks", the blue block with "core block", and the white block with the "product block".

NOTE: Copper blocks are only on ONE side which is ONLY on the LEFT of the sign with [Printer] on it.

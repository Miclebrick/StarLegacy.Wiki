# Nations and Settlements

## Settlements

Settlements are the groups that bind together to make nations. You can claim unclaimed regions to make settlements. To create one, use the command, in game; /s create <settlement name>

When you do this, it will tell you the price and ask you to confirm.

To keep a claim at least 1 member must have logged in within around the last 30 days. If no members of the settlement have logged in after about 30 days have passed, the settlement is automatically purged and deleted. The land is unclaimed and anyone can pillage and grief and steal from it.

Bonus: Every hour for every member counted as active (their name is green in /s info), the settlements bank will increase by 1 credit. For example: 3 members are in a settlement and all log in every day, the settlement would get 72 credits per day. If 2 members log in but one does not they will receive 72 credits per day for only a few days until that player's name turns gray, after that if the person who hasn't logged in doesn't log in the settlement savings will increase by only 48 credits per day if the other two members are active.

> /s info **OR** /s info {settlement}

This command will give you a list of the people in your settlement, their ranks, and other very useful information about your settlement.

This command can also be used to see other settlements by specifying the settlement name.

## Nations

Nations are useful in claiming more regions around your settlement and on other various planets.

To create a nation, you must be at least Rank V (Aka. Rank Five), then use the command, in game; /n create {name} {Red Value} {Green Value} {Blue Value}
To pick a color you want go on the website below: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp?color=rgb(0,%20191,%20255) The colorID #s go in order from top to bottom R then G than B.

Nations will be deleted should the capital settlement is auto-purged and there is no member settlement with an active leader that can be automatically made the new capital.

Bonus: Every hour for every active member, the nations bank will increase by 4 credits. For example: 3 members are in a nation and all log in every day, the nation would get 288 credits per day. 2 members log in but one does not they will receive 288 credits per day until that player's name turns gray, after that if the person who hasn't logged in doesn't log in the nation will increase by only 192 credits per day if the other two members are active.

To add settlements to a nation the nation leader must do the command /n invite {settlement}. The settlement leader must than do /n join {nation} to join the nation it was invited to.

> /n info **OR** /n info {nation}

This command will give you a list of the people in your nation, their ranks, and other very useful information about your nation, as well as other nations.

## Determining Relations

In order to tell whether a player is enemy or ally, you can do /pinfo {player} to find out information about them. It will inform you of their settlement, nation, your relation with their nation, and their rank. **ALWAYS** perform this command when you feel threatened by a player or you want to attack a player.

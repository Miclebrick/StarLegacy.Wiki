# Energy Swords
This was the formal weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster. More skill than simple sight was required for its use. An elegant weapon. It was a symbol as well. Anyone can use a blaster or a fusioncutter but to use a lightsaber well, was a mark of someone above the ordinary.

## Info
Energy Swords are capable of deflecting blasters bolts, dealing good damage, and looking epic. You can only craft yellow energy swords unless you donate for other colors. Make sure you have the latest resourcepack version!

## Cargo Trading
### Step One
------
To start trading you first need to find a trade city to buy crates from.
-  There are trade outposts on every planet,
   - Their names all begin with the planet name and end in "-ost".

   ![outpost]
> The above example is the outpost from Quod Canis, hence the name "Quodcanost".

### Step Two
-----

 Once you have arrived and either landed or docked, locate the Importer and Exporter Npcs.

> They are easy to locate and have a variety of skins.

### Step Three
-----

Right click on the Exporter Npc to get a cargo crate mission.
  - You will see a GUI simlar to the one below.

 Hovering your cursor over each crate will bring up lots more info to consider.
  - Destination - Outpost name and planet to deliver to.
  - Total Crates - Ammount of crates to be purchased and thus placed in your ship.
  - Cost - Total cost to buy all the crates.
  - Route Value - The Higher the value the more xp given and higher potential profit. Max is 2.0.
  - Days until expiry - How many days given to comlete mission.

### Step Four
-----

 Once you have found the right mission left click to accept.
- The crates will be given and any not able to fit into the inventory will be dropped on the ground.
    - Only you will be able to pick these crates up for 1 hour so get them quickly!
    - You can sell back crates at cost to an Importer in the same outpost you purchased them from.
    - Sell the unwanted crates back by right clicking the importer with the crates in your inventory.



### Step Five
-----

 Head back to your ship with the crates and place them on your sticky piston heads.

![crates]
> Ensure your pistons are wired up so you can use a redstone pulse to release the crates in outpost land!

Crates have special rules to be noted.
- Crates are not able to be placed into any kind of container.
- Crates can only be held in the player inventory if not flying.
  - Upon piloting all held crates will be dropped.
- Crates can only be placed on sticky piston heads and must not be adjacent to another crate, even diagonally.

### Step Six
-----

After you are loaded up with crates, locate your destination on the dynmap and fly there.
> Watch out for pirates! 
- Locate the Importer and Exporter Npcs with the crates in your inventory. 
- Right click the Importer Npc this time and you should see a message similar to the one below.

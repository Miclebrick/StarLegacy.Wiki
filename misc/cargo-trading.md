# Cargo Trading
Cargo trading between planet based Outposts and Trade Cities is the main and best way to obtain credits and XP in the late game.

## Required Items
There are a few things that are needed to trade cargo between planets and a few that are highly recommended.

**Required**
   - Credits to purchase crates, 1000-1000c should get you started
   - A starship with some sticky pistons(for the crates) and a hyperdrive
   - A space suit to survive in space and the harsh conditions of some planets

**Recommended**
   - [Power armor](https://starlegacy.net/wiki/gear/power_gear)  with corresponding modules. 
     - (Enviromental module and rocket boots are especially useful).
   - A [navigation computer](https://starlegacy.net/wiki/starships/navigation_computer)
   - [Shields](https://starlegacy.net/wiki/starships/particle_shields) and [ship weaponry](https://starlegacy.net/wiki/starships/weapons) to help fend of any pirates.
   - [Blasters](https://starlegacy.net/wiki/gear/blasters) for protection against mobs and pirates.

## Cargo Trading
### Step One
---

To start trading you first need to find a NPC Outpost or Trade City to buy crates from.
#### NPC Outposts
-  There are NPC Outposts on every planet
   - NPC Outposts end with 'ost'

   ![outpost]
> The above example is the NPC Outpost on Quod Canis, hence the name "Quodcanost"
#### Trade City
- Trade Cities are player owned settlements and are located on various worlds
   - Trade Cities are identified by the green territories
	![atc]
> The above picture is of Acracia on Terram. All Trade Cities will be green when they meet activity and tax requirements

   - When a Trade City is considered inactive, it disables all trading at the Trade City and turns the territory red
	![itc]
> The above picture is of Kragostani in its inactive state. All Trade Cities will turn red when they go down and will go green once activity/tax requirements are met

### Step Two
---

Once you have arrived and either landed or docked, locate the Importer and Exporter NPCs.

![npcs]
> They are easy to locate and have a variety of skins.

### Step Three
---

Right-click on the Exporter NPC to get a cargo crate mission.
  - You will see a GUI simlar to the one below.
	![missions]

 Hovering your cursor over each crate will bring up lots more info to consider.
  - Destination - Says the NPC Outpost or Trade City as well as the planet
  - Cost - The ammount you will be spending per crate
  - Days until expiry - How many days given to deliever crates to destination
  > For the example above, you have 5 days to deliever crates to Atlantis on Quod Canis. It'd cost 1,081.8 credits to purchase 10 crates. 

### Step Four
---

Once you have found the right mission left-click to accept.
- Once you have selected a mission, you'll get a message in the chat box
	![crate ammount]
- Type the amount of crates you wish to purchase into the chat 
   - Once you enter the ammount of crates you want, you'll recieve the following message with the crates on the ground:

### Step Five
---

 Head back to your ship with the crates and place them on your sticky piston heads.

![crates]
> Ensure your pistons are wired up so you can use a redstone pulse to release the crates upon arrival!

Crates have special rules to be noted.
- Crates are not able to be placed into any kind of container.
- Crates can only be held in the player inventory if not flying.
  - Upon piloting all held crates will be dropped.
- Crates can only be placed on sticky piston heads and must not be adjacent to another crate, even diagonally.

### Step Six
-----

After you are loaded up with crates, locate your destination on the dynmap and fly there
- Locate the Importer and Exporter NPCs with the crates in your inventory. 
- Right-click the Importer NPC this time and you should see a message similar to the one below once all crates are sold.

Take your newly earned money and buy some more crates and repeat the process!

## Quick Notes

Big hills, huge trees. Spiders and creepers. The entire planet was originally claimed by Arimfea, the owner's nation. It used to be feared and anyone who dared to step foot on this planet was destroyed immediately. The nation has long since fallen, but the planet continues to contain old relics of the time.

## Quick Notes

Harenum is the red desert planet. It has tons of sand, iron, gold, and even diamonds. With its canyons and mountains, the landscape is rarely flat. There are many zombies and cacti waiting to ambush you so always watch where you step. You'll need a space suit or environmental helmet to survive the atmosphere during daylight hours. This planet is mainly used for mining, due to its rich ore deposits. Due to its remote nature, Harenum is a relatively safe planet.

# Founding
Nations are collections of settlements that have formed into a larger entity. To form a nation, four requirements must be met. You must have a population, a land claim, some credits, and a high enough level.

### Population
Your population includes the players who will become citizens of your nation. This may just be you or it may be a group of your friends. Anyone in your settlement will become a citizen when you form your nation. To invite someone to become a citizen after forming your nation, you must invite them to your settlement with `/s invite [player]` or invite the settlement they are a part of with `/n invite [settlement]`.

### Claiming Land
A nation must possess a territory claim in order to form and persist. A land claim may be created by forming a settlement in an unclaimed territory. To form a settlement, you must be at least Level 7. Locate an unclaimed territory on the map. When you travel to the location, run the command `/s create [name] [price]`. The price of the territory is dependant on the size of the land claim.

### Cost and Leveling
The fee for forming a nation is C20,000. Money can be obtained in many ways, but detailed explanations of money-making may be found elsewhere on the wiki. Before forming a nation, you must be Level 24. This can be achieved by purchasing slxp or by using any current money making method.

## Founding a Nation
After meeting the requirements, you may form a nation. The command to found a nation is `/n create [name] [R] [G] [B] [cost]`. `[name]` will be the name of your nation. `[R] [G] [B]` is an RGB code, determining the color of your power armor and nation claims on the map. `[cost]` is the fee to form the nation.

## Disbanding
Disbanding a nation removes all settlements from the nation and deletes all nation-owned claims. Any settlements that were in the nation will remain claimed. Money in the national bank will be permenantly deleted and all relations with other nations will be voided.

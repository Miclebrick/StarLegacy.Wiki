# Relations
Relations are a system of statuses between nations. They indicate many things, as well as influence some game features.

#### None
This relation indicates a nation has not officially determined their relationship towards another nation. This relation is the default.

#### Ally
This relation indicates that a nation has aligned itself with another nation. This relation unlocks the ally chat, which is a private chat between allies. Both sides must express interest in an alliance to make the relation official.

#### Neutral
This relation is the most vague relation, as different nations define Neutral differently. Generally, this relation indicates a lack of hard opinion regarding a nation. Both sides must express neutrality to make the relation official.

#### Enemy
This relation indicates that a nation has expressed disapproval or has declared war on another nation. This relation triggers AP Turrets automatically, causing targetted fire on enemies to occur without player input. Only one side must declare an enemy to make the relation official.
